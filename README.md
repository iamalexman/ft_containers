# ft_containers
ðŸ“¦ðŸ§® In the project implements several containers types from C++ standard template library (STL)

The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement common data structures like queues, lists and stacks. There are three classes of containers -- sequence containers, associative containers, and unordered associative containers -- each of which is designed to support a different set of operations.
The container manages the storage space that is allocated for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators (objects with properties similar to pointers).

### In this project, I implemented:
### Vector
Dynamic array is used in the data structure.
### Map
Is based on Red - Black tree.
### Stack
Is based on Vector.
### Set
Is based on Red - Black tree.

- All containers include member and non-member functions, overload operators and iterators.
- SFINAE
- Pair, make_pair, ...
- std::allocator and allocator::rebind
